# AI_lab_projects

This includes a set of assignments which were done as part of the AI lab course at IIT Palakkad. 
Some notable ones are an 8 puzzle solver (using A* search) and a tic-tac-toe agent (using adversarial search).

The eight puzzle-solver was re-written in C to improve the execution time.
